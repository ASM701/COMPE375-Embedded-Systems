# COMPE 375 – Embedded Systems Programming

Lab assignments for an embedded systems course at San Diego State University, focused on programming the **ATmega328PB microcontroller** in C using Atmel Studio and AVR libraries.

**Topics covered:** GPIO, UART, Timers, PWM, ADC, Keypads, EEPROM

## Labs Overview

| Lab | Topic | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| Lab 1 | GPIO & Morse Code | Blinks an LED on pin PB5 to output a name and ID in Morse code |
| Lab 2 | UART Transmission | Transmits a string over UART to a terminal via an FT232R breakout board |
| Lab 3 | UART + Keypad Input | Reads keypad button presses and sends the corresponding character to a terminal over UART |
| Lab 4 | PWM & Button Control | Gradually brightens/dims an LED using PWM based on a button press/release |
| Lab 5 | Timers & Tone Generation | Plays musical tones through an AUX speaker based on keypad input using CTC timer mode |
| Lab 6 | Keypad + PWM LED Control | Controls LED brightness via PWM based on which key is pressed on a 4x4 keypad |
| Lab 7 | ADC + Potentiometer | Reads analog input from a potentiometer via ADC and maps it to LED brightness using PWM |
| Lab 8 | EEPROM Persistence | Persists LED duty cycle across power cycles using EEPROM read/write |

## Key Concepts Practiced

- **GPIO** – Configuring pins as input/output using DDR and PORT registers
- **UART** – Serial communication using USART registers at 9600 baud
- **Timers (CTC mode)** – Generating precise time intervals using Timer0/Timer2 with prescalers
- **PWM** – Controlling LED brightness via duty cycle using OCR registers
- **ADC** – Reading analog voltage from a potentiometer and mapping it to digital output
- **Interrupts** – Using ISRs for timer compare matches and ADC conversion complete events
- **EEPROM** – Reading and writing persistent data across power cycles using `avr/eeprom.h`
